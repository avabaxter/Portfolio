**Math Game**

Link: https://github.com/Joeyseph/Team-Penguin

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a group project that i worked on for my Software Engineering class. The goal of this project was to create an educational math game web application aimed at children ages 6â€“8 that would track the scores of individual students, allowing teachers to monitor their progress. We used the agile model of software development in creating this project. The project had an interface designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and connected to a MySQL server to store user information. This project helped familiarize me with software engineering practices, and especially collaborative software engineering. Because of how the project was designed, i got experience with both front-end and back-end design. I feel that this project has prepared me for software development on a professional level.

**Java Parser**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a group project that i worked on for my Compilers class. The goal of this project was to create a parser for the Java programming language. It takes a Java program as input and gives an abstract syntax tree as output. This project helped familiarize me with with the internal workings of compilers, and helped me to understand programming language design, both of which are important for a theoretical understanding of computers. This project also gave me experience with collaborative programming. I feel that this project has prepared me for both systems programming on a professional level and further study of computer science at an academic level.
