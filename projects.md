# Projects

### Senior capstone project

This is the project I did for my senior capstone. It is an online searchable verb dictionary for the Navajo language. My goal was to create a prototype for a much more comprehensive dictionary that could be used by learners of the Navajo language.

This was a very complex project that required critical thinking in analyzing materials on the Navajo language and creativity in designing the presentation of the information in a user-friendly way. It helped me understand the techniques of software design, particularly the design of web applications which I had little experience with before. This project also demonstrates my commitment to global responsibility in the form of working to preserve threatened languages.

### Java Parser

This is a group project that I worked on for my Compilers class. The goal of this project was to create a parser for the Java programming language. It takes a Java program as input and gives an abstract syntax tree as output.

This project helped familiarize me with with the internal workings of compilers, and helped me to understand programming language design, both of which are important for a theoretical understanding of computers. This project also gave me experience with collaborative programming and effective communication. I feel that this project has prepared me for both systems programming on a professional level and further study of computer science at an academic level.

### Math Game

This is a group project that I worked on for my Software Engineering class. The goal of this project was to create an educational math game web application aimed at children ages 6â€“8 that would track the scores of individual students, allowing teachers to monitor their progress. We used the agile model of software development in creating this project.

This project helped familiarize me with software engineering practices, and especially collaborative software engineering. Because of how the project was designed, I got experience with both front-end and back-end design. I feel that this project has prepared me for software development on a professional level. Because this was a remote class, this project also helped me develop communication skills.

### Privilege escalation demonstration

This is a project that I did for my Computer Security class. It is a simple demonstration of a stack overflow-based privilege escalation attack.

This project helped me learn about how computers function on the lowest level, since it required manipulation of binary code. This also required me to use technical problem-solving skills as it was very difficult to implement. It also helped me learn about how to design software to account for attacks like this.

### Proof portfolio

This project is portfolio summarizing what I learned in my Abstract Algebra class. It shows a number of different proofs I was required to write in order to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts the class covered.

This project required problem solving and critical thinking skills as I had to develop rigorous mathematical proofs. I worked on part of this project with a teammate, demonstrating collaboration and communication skills.

### Navajo data analysis

This is a project I did for my statistics class. It is a statistical analysis of the prevalence of Navajo language proficiency on the Navajo Nation.

This project required critical thinking skills of the kind that are necessary for data analysis. It also demonstrates my commitment to global responsibility.
